## Synopsis
You play as an apple who has suddenly gained sentience and quickly realizes that humans are doing a very bad thing: eating food! Your goal is to collect all of the food and escape in three levels without getting caught. Avoid the humans, hide under obstacles, or sprint to get away! You also have to keep in mind that the food will trail you wherever you go leaving much more vulerable, but no food gets left behind!

## How To Download
If you would like to play the game for yourself, navigate to `Food_Freedom_Frenzy/Builds` then download the `Food Freedom Frenzy Game` folder. All files in this folder are necessary for the game to run. After downloading, you can simply open the `Food_Freedom_Frenzy.exe` file to start playing. We hope you enjoy!

## Our Team
### Joseph Cognata
Hello, My name is Joseph Cognata. I am currently a senior student at Eastern Michigan University studying Computer Science. I'm 21 years old and I will be happily graduating in the fall! My goal for this project is to get hands on experience with Unity and C#.

### Brandon Jones
I am a senior computer science student graduating in December 2022. My goal for this project and class was to gain experience with C#, Unity, and game development in general. I primarily worked on the AI for the humans in this game. The AI utilizes a state machine to switch between 5 main states: Patrol, Idle, Suspicious (humans will rotate when they sense that something is near), Chase, and Attack (triggers the game over screen when in contact with the player).
